Dear professor Mizrahi

Many confusions.
I believe pressure throught exams and all assignments are adding difficulties.

This assignment are incomplete. I don't think this sybmission will be accepted.
However, I'll leave a recording of struggles here and look for relevant help after the exam on wednesday.

In this file, test_unconstrained_min.py, I expect to :

define testing plots. 

test of each examples with methods according to specific restrictions required 
(to be argument of the functions)

track result 'res' and path 'path_to' of the search_lin to be recorded
then plot using utils to project iteration/ objetive function plots.
